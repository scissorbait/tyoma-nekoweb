        <p>My name is Tyoma! I'm a 23 year old artist and web developer and I will not lie, after at least a decade or so, I have finally begun to get fed up with the overly corporate web we've gotten stuck with. I've been looking alot at old fansites and such and missed the sense of individuality there was with everyone having their own fully-customized site... Ah, the good old days... So that's why I'm here! I've been running this site since around 2018 and have only recently finally figured out what to do with it.</p>
        <p>I think one of the most important things to know about me is that I see myself as a tribute to everything in this world that I love. From the way I dress, to how I wear my hair, to the way I talk, and even to my names... I'm everything I like rolled up into one guy! You'll see a lot of links and general displays/collections of things I enjoy because they are just sort of an inherent part of who I am at this point. Music is one of the most important things in the world to me, it's my lifeblood, so there are references to it all over the place. Other than that I'm into a bunch of random little things, although my main thing right now is just surfing the web and a deep fascination with the 2000s. I also draw! I plan to include a proper art section one of these days but for now you can find my drawings scattered across the site.</p>
        <p>I used to be a very different person pre-2021, but recently I reset my entire life and I'm basically living as the person I think younger me would be proud of. Nothing is ever static so I hope this webpage can evolve along with me, and I hope you all enjoy the ride :^)</p>
        <h2>Artist statement</h2>
        <p>Evidently I don't have much of a way with words, so my art is the best  way for me to express myself. I'm also a naturally very scared person so drawing is my main outlet for complex, distressing, and taboo thoughts.  Some of my art is meant to feel cozy and soft while other pieces are  directly intended to discomfort the viewer. I value art that challenges  me more than anything, so I want to inspire a bit of reflection and  empathy in people who view my work.</p>
        <p>I aim to imbue all my art with a soul the way my favorite musicians can evoke such strong feelings within a 3 minute song. Everything I create comes from a place of love for the indomitable human spirit. It's so important to me to be able to get across emotions and relationships through the expressions and body language of my characters (hence my love for portraits). Most of all, I want those feelings to resonate with all the people who don't feel seen or represented. That goes for all the fat lesbian perverts, mentally ill girls, biracial nerds, people fascinated by the grotesque, sufferers of moral scrupulosity, and the NEETs with big dreams whose lives are solely contained in their bedrooms. I will defend you all 'til my last dying breath.</p>
        <p>I like to work with whatever medium strikes my fancy, which is either digital art (made in Clip Studio Paint) or traditional art made with whatever tools I have within arm's reach. Pencil sketches are my favorites, sometimes upgraded with white charcoal on tan paper. Most of my inspiration comes from music that has touched my soul and drives most of my best work. As for other visual art, I love the paintings of the 19th century Realism and Romanticism movements, plus those old religious paintings from the Christian and Jewish traditions. I also find cinematic compositions fun to create, drawing from the surreal sensibilities of directors like David Lynch and Ralph Bakshi.</p>
        <h2>Here's some trivia about me!</h2>

          <li>I am double-jointed, which was a cool trick when I was younger but now it means I have knee pain.</li>
          <li>In 6th grade, I wrote a 15+ page paper on the history of computers. We only needed to write 3 pages.</li>
          <li>I attended the very first Roblox Rally back in 2011.</li>
          <li>I still have every video game console I've ever owned.</li>
