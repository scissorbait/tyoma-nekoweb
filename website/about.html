               <p><span class="bold">Special Containment Procedures: </span>SCP-8962 is to be contained in a locked chamber in a secure containment facility. Subject is to be kept under constant supervision by authorized personnel with Level-5 access with assigned staff on call to make modifications to its chamber when necessary.</p>
               <p>The subject's chamber should include one (1) 27-inch JVC color television set, one (1) Sony PS One video game console, a rotating assortment of at least five (5) PS One video games, one (1) blank page notebook, two (2) 2B pencils, one (1) pencil sharpener, one (1) rubber eraser, one (1) cow-pattern Peepy, and one (1) 3-foot dolphin stuffed toy. None of these items are to be removed from SCP-8962's chamber under any circumstances. </p>
               <p><span class="bold">Description:</span> SCP-8962 is a small, 1.67m tall humanoid entity with textured hair which can consistently be found wearing an oversized t-shirt with a long-sleeved, red-and-black striped shirt underneath along with grey knee-length shorts. Subject has expressed a preference for the name 'Tyoma' and insists it be addressed with 'he/him', 'it/its', or 'she/her' pronouns. Subject is known to become hostile when knowingly referred to with 'they/them' pronouns.</p>
               <p>SCP-8962 is capable of standard verbal and written communication in either English or French and exhibits behaviors similar to a human adult diagnosed with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) or Obessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p>
               <p>Staff assigned to SCP-8962's observance are encouraged to engage in conversation with it. Subject has been known to talk for hours about different genres of rock music or 'Pathologic', a Russian computer game originally released in 2005. Though the subject will claim it is currently running an online website in dedication to the game, the actual website or any traces of it have not yet been discovered.</p>
               <p>When SCP-8962 reports dissatisfaction with its surroundings or mental state, it is imperative that steps are taken to calm it down or else it will revert to a colorless, quadrupedal form. In this state, the subject's behavior is highly unpredictable and all staff should avoid entering the subject's chamber until it reverts back to a humanoid form. While the extent of its abilities are still unknown, SCP-8962 has been able to distort reality within its chamber, standing completely still as the interior of the room shifted to resemble the inside of a CVS Pharmacy. When asked, SCP-8962 has reported having no memory of ever entering such a state.</p>
