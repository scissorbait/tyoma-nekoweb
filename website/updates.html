                <p>CD Review: Songs for the Deaf by QOTSA. Music Review: The Downward Spiral by NIN. Added a few more links to the links page and did a few switcheroos here and there. Hopefully I can continue with more frequent updates on this site :^) Soon I'll try to add an archive of Semi-Daily Images, since I think alot of them are really funny. </p>

                <p>Added some articles I liked to the links page. I imagine this section will completely overflow with web-related articles at some point...</p>

                <p><b>11/13/2021</b></p>
                <p>I added a bunch of little mini updates all over the place, and finally added a Reviews section to the sidebar! Kinda barren for now, but there's at least a game review up right now :^) Kinda want to focus on getting all the pages I want here up and running so I can go back to optimize my code and mainly focus on writing rather than fighting to get everything working and looking nice. In time!</p>
